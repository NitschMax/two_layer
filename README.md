Python code for the simulation of the euclidean sandpile model with periodic boundary conditions.
The routines are encoded in a class called grid in the file sandpile.py.
Currently the time step works only for quadratic lattices.

In main.py the lattices are built and simulated.

data dir .py tells the algorithm where the data is stored on the machine.

In evaluate.py the simulated lattices are loaded and analysed.
